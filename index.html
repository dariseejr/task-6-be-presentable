<h1>CONTROVERSIAL</h1>

<h1>Attacking</h1>
<aside class= "notes">
Almost as soon as the album dropped, Swift fans began attacking West for using her likeness in such a derogatory way. Kanye West then responded with a series of tweets detailing the song's origins, stating that he had “called Taylor and had an hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.” He even went so far as to state that the lyric had “actually [been] something Taylor came up with.”

<h1>Acceptance speech</h1>
<aside class= "notes">
At the 2016 Grammys, Swift gave a brief nod to the situation at hand during her acceptance speech for 2016 Album of the Year. Her speech included many subtle references to interactions between herself and West, most noticeably when she stated that “there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”

<h1>JULY 2016</h1>
<aside class= "notes">
July 2016 has been the most dramatic time of this whole narrative. One of the latest episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians featured a scene in which Kim discussed the entire situation, namely the contents of the GQ interview, with older sister Kourtney. And just when things couldn’t get good enough, Kim released the videos of the phone call to her SnapChat.

<h1>Written in advance?</h1>
<aside class= "notes">
It was an emotional statement that was clearly well thought out; however, some instagram users noticed that it appeared that the note had been written far in advance to the snapchat release. Like it or not, there is some suspicious activity on Swift’s part; however, equally shocking is the fact that she may consider pressing charges against Kim and Kanye West due to the state of California’s recording privacy laws.
