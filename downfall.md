THE DOWNFALL OF TAYLOR SWIFT. Few people are better known in pop culture than the Kardashian clan and singer Taylor Swift. Both parties have constantly been in the limelight for upwards of ten years, but recently headlines have been exploding with

relations between herself and West had improved and that he had even apologized to both her and her mother. The tension between West and Swift subsided for a few years, and the two even appeared at awards shows together in seemingly friendly embraces. It got to the point that essentially everyone in Hollywood believed that

Were they ever wrong.

# CONTROVERSIAL
<aside class= "notes">
In West’s newest album, The Life of Pablo, his hit song “Famous” contains a controversial lyric that directly mentions Taylor Swift, stating “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous.”
</aside>
# Attacking
<aside class= "notes">
Almost as soon as the album dropped, Swift fans began attacking West for using her likeness in such a derogatory way. Kanye West then responded with a series of tweets detailing the song's origins, stating that he had “called Taylor and had an hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.” He even went so far as to state that the lyric had “actually [been] something Taylor came up with.”
</aside>
# Statement to the media
<aside class= "notes">
Swift’s publicists immediately released a statement to the media that claimed “Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single ‘Famous’ on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message
</aside>
# Never made aware
<aside class= "notes">
Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, ‘I made that bitch famous.’” 
</aside>
# Acceptance speech
<aside class= "notes">
At the 2016 Grammys, Swift gave a brief nod to the situation at hand during her acceptance speech for 2016 Album of the Year. Her speech included many subtle references to interactions between herself and West, most noticeably when she stated that “there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.”

# VIDEO RECORDING!
<aside class= "notes">
he tables turned when Kim Kardashian-West revealed in a GQ Magazine interview that not only did the initial phone call to Swift happen, but that she had a video recording of the actual conversation.
</aside>
# Distraction?
<aside class= "notes">
 Interestingly enough, the GQ issue that contained this interview was released just one day after news of Swift’s newest relationship, leaving some wondering if Swift had decided to go public in an effort to distract from Kim’s interview. 
 </aside>
# Music Video
<aside class= "notes">
Just a few weeks later, West was in the headlines again, this time for releasing the music video accompanying the very song that had caused so much drama to begin with. This video depicts Kanye and countless other celebrities--some in the form of wax figures-- naked in one giant bed. Among the celebrities featured was none other than Taylor Swift.

# No direct response
<aside class= "notes">
 There was no direct response from her publicity team.

# JULY 2016
<aside class= "notes">
July 2016 has been the most dramatic time of this whole narrative. One of the latest episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians featured a scene in which Kim discussed the entire situation, namely the contents of the GQ interview, with older sister Kourtney. And just when things couldn’t get good enough, Kim released the videos of the phone call to her SnapChat.

# Videos Released to SnapChat

# "Go with whatever line you think is better"
<aside class= "notes">
Comments from Swift regarding West’s lyric suggestions included to “go with whatever line you think is better”, that she “really appreciate[d] you telling me about it, that’s really nice!” and even that 
</aside>
# "I'm gonna be like-- he called me"
<aside class= "notes">
right after the song comes out I’m gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they’re gonna ask me about it and I’m gonna be like, “He called me.”” This evidence of the alleged conversation was the nail in the coffin of Swift’s role as the victim, and in the hours following Kim’s snapchat release Taylor released a statement in the form of a note on her instagram page. 
</aside>
# Asassination of Character
<aside class= "notes">
The instagram note stated that Swift “[could] not approve a song you haven’t heard.” She even went so far as to state that this was an assassination on her character.
</aside>
# Written in advance?
<aside class= "notes">
It was an emotional statement that was clearly well thought out; however, some instagram users noticed that it appeared that the note had been written far in advance to the snapchat release. Like it or not, there is some suspicious activity on Swift’s part; however, equally shocking is the fact that she may consider pressing charges against Kim and Kanye West due to the state of California’s recording privacy laws.
</aside>
# Privacy Laws
<aside class= "notes">
If an individual hasn’t been told that they are being recorded, then it is illegal to do so. Swift’s team allegedly sent Kim Kardashian a letter asking to destroy the recordings in the months prior to the current state of drama, and because Kim posted the video anyway she could face a

# Three years in state prison?
<aside class= "notes">
If convicted of a felony charge then sentences are harsher--up to three years in state prison or a $2500 fine.
</aside>
# Rare case
<aside class= "notes">
Attorneys interviewed by BuzzFeed news additionally stated that “this is one of the rare penal codes statutes that provide for civil recovery up to three times the amount of actual damages.” Additionally, West could be indicted as a co-conspirator if Swift decides to press charges.

# MOST IMPORTANT STORY OF THE YEAR

Folks, this could be the single most important story of the year. We are talking about the 
</aside>
# DOWNFALL
<aside class= "notes">
downfall of America’s sweetheart, someone who young adults have looked up to for close to ten years. If Swift comes out as a liar, who’s to say that someone as influential as our presidential candidates can’t be next? Today, our pop culture icons, tomorrow…...the world.
